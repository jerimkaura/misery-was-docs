Overview
========

We're tryna work on a project that we get to use as many technologies as possible (talking about microservices, Django, Redis, Object Storage, Sharding, Containerization and Orchestration, RabbitMQ messaging, Pdb debugging, etc).. & using those software engineering best practices (documentation, CI/CD etc).. In the form of a chat app.
It's for the long haul.. this project is also an end in itself.
